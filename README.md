## Projects
### Inefficient Operator Identification – CallMeMaybe
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/Inefficient_Operator_Identification) 

This project analyzes operational call center data to identify underperforming operators using statistical techniques in Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels) and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. A rule based model and statistical tests were implemented to classify operators based on missed calls, long wait times, and overall activity.

The results reveal significant differences between efficient and inefficient operators, enabling improvements in customer service through better resource allocation, reduced wait times, and targeted training prioritization.

### YouTube Trending History Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/YouTube-Trending-History-Analysis)

This project analyzes YouTube’s historical trending data to uncover consumption patterns by category and country. Using Python for preprocessing and Tableau for interactive visualization, it presents how categories evolve over time, which regions drive the highest volume, and how category market relationships shape audience behavior.

The results highlight clear distinctions across countries and categories, with Entertainment consistently leading globally. These insights help marketing and media teams optimize targeting, adjust budget allocation, and design content strategies based on real viewer trends.

### A/B Test in Food Products
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/A-A-B-Test-in-Food-Products)

This project analyzes user behavior in a food delivery app to evaluate whether a visual UI update specifically changes to font style and layout—impacted engagement or conversion. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels) for data processing and statistical testing, the study applies A/B testing, funnel analysis, and significance evaluations to compare user flows between the control and experimental groups.

The results show no statistically significant differences between groups A and B, indicating that the redesign did not affect user activity or conversion patterns. These findings support maintaining the current interface and suggest that future experiments should focus on structural or functional improvements, such as product placement or pricing visibility, which are more likely to produce meaningful behavioral change.

### Used Vehicles Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/Used_Vehicles_Analysis)

This project provides an interactive tool for exploring the U.S. used vehicle market through a Streamlit web application. Using Python, Pandas, and Plotly Express, the app visualizes price distributions and the relationship between mileage and pricing, allowing users such as buyers, analysts, or dealerships to explore market patterns in a simple and intuitive way.

The results reveal clear trends in pricing and mileage behavior, and the interface enables effortless insight discovery without technical expertise. The project demonstrates how interactive dashboards can support decision making in vehicle valuation, with potential future enhancements such as brand filters, predictive pricing models, and geographic analysis.
