## Projects
### Inefficient Operator Identification – CallMeMaybe
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/Inefficient_Operator_Identification) 

This project analyzes call center operational data to identify underperforming operators using statistical techniques in Python and visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn. A rule based model and hypothesis tests classify operators based on missed calls, long wait times, and activity levels.

The results show clear differences between efficient and inefficient operators, supporting better resource allocation, reduced wait times, and improved customer service through targeted training.

### A/B Test in Food Products
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/A-A-B-Test-in-Food-Products)

This project evaluates whether a UI redesign in a food delivery app mainly font and layout changes impacts user engagement or conversion. Python based A/B testing and funnel analysis compare behavioral patterns between control and experimental groups.

Results show no statistically significant differences, indicating the redesign had no effect. Insights suggest focusing future tests on functional or structural changes with higher potential impact.

### Used Vehicles Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/JDavidSA/Used_Vehicles_Analysis)

This project delivers an interactive Streamlit tool to explore the U.S. used vehicle market. Using Python, Pandas, and Plotly, it visualizes price distributions and the relationship between mileage and value for easy, intuitive analysis.

Clear pricing and mileage patterns emerge, helping users identify market trends quickly. The dashboard demonstrates how interactive analytics can support decision making in vehicle evaluation.
